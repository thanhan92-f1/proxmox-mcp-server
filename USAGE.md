### First Commands

Try these to verify everything works:

```
List all nodes in my Proxmox cluster
```

```

```

```
What are the specs of VM 105?
```

```
How much memory does VM 110 have?
```

**Detailed queries:**

### Running Commands with the QEMU Guest Agent

`vm_agent_exec` runs a program inside a VM and returns its process ID. Pass the
program in `command` and each argument separately in `args`. Use
`vm_agent_exec_status` with the returned PID to check whether the process has
exited and read its stdout and stderr.

For example, to list the highest-CPU processes in a Windows VM, run
`powershell.exe` with the following `args`:

```text
-NoProfile
-Command
Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 10 ProcessName,Id,CPU | ConvertTo-Json -Compress
```

Poll `vm_agent_exec_status` with the returned PID until `exited` is true. The
result includes the process exit code as well as captured stdout and stderr.
The QEMU Guest Agent must be enabled and running inside the VM.

## Best Practices

### 1. Descriptive Snapshot Names

❌ **Poor:**
```
Create a snapshot "snap1" for VM 100
```

✅ **Good:**
```
Create a snapshot "backup-before-update-2025-01-15" for VM 100 on pve1 with description "Pre-kernel update backup"
```

### 2. Graceful Shutdowns

❌ **Poor:**
```
Stop VM 100
```

✅ **Good:**
```
Shutdown VM 100 gracefully with 120 second timeout
```

Use `stop_vm` only when necessary:
```
VM 100 is not responding, force stop it
```

### 3. Verify Before Acting

❌ **Poor:**
```
Start all VMs
```

✅ **Good:**
```
Show me which VMs are stopped, then start them one by one
```

### 4. Use Clear Node References

❌ **Poor:**
```
What's the status of VM 100?
```

✅ **Good:**
```
What's the status of VM 100 on pve1?
```

### 5. Monitor Long-Running Operations

✅ **Good:**
```
Start VM 100, then check the task status
```

```
Create snapshot for VM 100, show me when it's complete
```

### 6. Regular Health Checks

**Daily:**
```
Show me cluster status and any issues
```

**Weekly:**
```
List all snapshots and identify old ones for cleanup
```

```
Show me storage usage trends
```

**Monthly:**
```
Create a comprehensive cluster health report
```

## Tips and Tricks

### Natural Language Flexibility

Claude understands various phrasings:

```
"List all nodes"
"Show me the nodes"
"What nodes do I have?"
"Display cluster nodes"
```

All produce the same result!

### Be Specific When Needed

For faster, more accurate responses:
- Include node names: "on pve1"
- Use VM IDs: "VM 100"
- Specify timeframes: "in the last hour"

### Ask Follow-Up Questions

```
User: "Show me all VMs"
Claude: [Shows VM list]
User: "What's the status of VM 100?"
Claude: [Shows VM 100 status]
User: "Start it"
Claude: [Starts VM 100]
```

### Request Summaries

```
"Summarize cluster health in 3 bullet points"
```

```
"Give me a TLDR of storage usage"
```

### Ask for Explanations

```
"What does VM status 'qmpstatus: stopped' mean?"
```

```
"Explain the difference between stop and shutdown"
```

---

## Error Handling

Claude will help you understand and resolve errors:

```
User: "Start VM 999 on pve1"
Claude: "I got an error - VM 999 doesn't exist on pve1. 
        Let me list the available VMs..."
```

```
User: "Shutdown VM 100"
Claude: "I need to know which node VM 100 is on. 
        Let me check... VM 100 is on pve1. 
        Shutting it down now..."
```

---

## Getting Help

If you're unsure what to ask:

```
"What can you help me with for Proxmox?"
```

```
"Show me examples of what I can do"
```

```
"How do I manage VMs?"
```

- `limit` (number, optional): Maximum number of tasks
- `vmid` (number, optional): Only tasks for this guest
- `statusfilter`, `typefilter`, `userfilter`, `source`, `since`, `until`, `start` (optional): Further filters

**Example:**
```
List the last 30 tasks on pve1
```

#### get_task_status
Gets status of a specific task.

**Parameters:**
- `node` (string, required): Node name
- `upid` (string, required): Task UPID

**Example:**
```
Check status of task UPID:pve1:0000ABCD:...
```

### Cluster Tools

#### get_cluster_status
Gets overall cluster status and resources.

**Parameters:** None

**Example:**
```
Show me the cluster status
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Descriptive Snapshot Names

Instead of:
```
Create a snapshot called "snap1" for VM 100
```

Use:
```
Create a snapshot called "pre-kernel-update-2025-01" for VM 100 with description "Before updating from kernel 5.15 to 6.1"
```

### 2. Graceful Shutdowns

Prefer `shutdown_vm` over `stop_vm` when possible:
```
Shutdown VM 100 gracefully
```

Use `stop_vm` only when necessary:
```
Force stop VM 100 (it's not responding)
```

### 3. Check Before Acting

For critical operations, check status first:
```
Show me the status of VM 100, then shut it down gracefully
```

### 4. Monitor Long-Running Tasks

```
Start VM 100, then show me the task status
```

### 5. Resource Monitoring

Regularly check cluster resources:
```
Show me an overview of cluster resources and alert me if anything is over 90% utilized
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Error: HTTP 401"
- Check your authentication credentials
- Verify API token hasn't expired
- Ensure user has appropriate permissions

### "Error: HTTP 403"
- User/token lacks required permissions
- Check Proxmox permissions for the user/token
- Common needed permissions: VM.Monitor, VM.Audit, Datastore.Audit, Sys.Audit

### "Error: HTTP 500"
- Internal Proxmox error
- Check Proxmox logs: `/var/log/pve/tasks/`
- Verify the node is healthy

### "Connection refused"
- Check PROXMOX_HOST and PROXMOX_PORT
- Verify network connectivity
- Check if Proxmox web interface is accessible

### Tool Not Available
- Restart Claude Desktop after configuration changes
- Check stderr output for authentication errors
- Verify the server is running correctly

## Security Tips

1. **Use API Tokens**: More secure than password authentication
2. **Minimal Permissions**: Grant only required permissions
3. **Token Expiration**: Set expiration dates on tokens
4. **Regular Audits**: Review API token usage regularly
5. **Secure Storage**: Never commit credentials to version control
6. **Network Security**: Use firewall rules to restrict API access
7. **SSL Verification**: Enable in production with valid certificates

## Performance Tips

1. **Filter by Node**: When possible, specify the node to reduce API calls
2. **Limit Results**: Use the `limit` parameter for task lists
3. **Batch Operations**: Ask Claude to perform multiple operations in sequence
4. **Cache Results**: Claude can remember results within a conversation

## Integration Examples

### With Automation Scripts

You can ask Claude to help create automation workflows:
```
Help me create a procedure for updating VM 100: create snapshot, shutdown, wait, update, start
```

### With Monitoring

```
Check all VMs and let me know which ones are using more than 80% memory
```

### With Maintenance

```
List all VMs, identify which ones can be updated today (not running critical services)
```

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the main README.md for configuration
2. Review Proxmox API documentation
3. Check Claude Desktop logs
4. Verify Proxmox server logs
5. Test API access with `curl` or `pvesh`

## Example Session

Here's a complete example session managing VMs:

**User:** "Show me all VMs in my cluster"

**Claude:** *Uses list_vms tool* "You have 5 VMs across 2 nodes..."

**User:** "Which ones are currently running?"

**Claude:** "Based on the status, VMs 100, 102, and 105 are running..."

**User:** "Create a snapshot of VM 100 called 'backup-before-update'"

**Claude:** *Uses create_vm_snapshot* "Snapshot created successfully..."

**User:** "Now gracefully shutdown VM 100"

**Claude:** *Uses shutdown_vm* "VM 100 is shutting down..."

**User:** "Check if it's stopped"

**Claude:** *Uses get_vm_status* "VM 100 is now stopped..."

**User:** "List all snapshots for VM 100"

**Claude:** *Uses list_vm_snapshots* "VM 100 has 2 snapshots: 'backup-before-update' and 'backup-weekly'..."
